# beacn-link-linux

Independent, unofficial Linux compatibility research; not affiliated with BEACN.

Status: documentation and static evidence only. The Link protocol is undecoded.
Native Linux runtime behavior is untested. No replacement implementation exists.

Goal: a Linux gaming PC connected through BEACN Studio while the Windows
streaming PC retains BEACN App and Mix Create. First prove that one Linux
application can appear in Windows App and be routed from it.

Keep proprietary binaries, raw captures, secrets, device serial numbers and
machine-specific endpoint GUIDs outside Git. Protocol identifiers and the
inspected executable hash are documented for reproducibility.
GitHub Actions must remain disabled; no workflow files are included.
